# Hematological Image Segmentation CCL
This project implements a classical image processing pipeline to segment white blood cell (WBC) components, cytoplasm and nucleus from hematological (blood smear) images using Connected Component Analysis (CCA). The approach begins with histogram-based analysis and pixel intensity inspection to determine optimal grayscale value ranges (V-sets) that effectively differentiate between the background, cytoplasm, and nucleus. CCA is then applied in two stages: the first isolates the entire WBC (cytoplasm + nucleus) from the background, and the second extracts the nucleus from the cytoplasm using a refined V-set. To enhance segmentation quality, post-processing is performed to retain only the two largest components in each image, eliminating small artifacts and noise. The segmented outputs are then mapped to specific grayscale values 128 for cytoplasm and 255 for nucleus to match the corresponding ground truth mask format. The final segmentation result, which combines both cytoplasmic and nuclear regions, is quantitatively evaluated using the Dice Coefficient, a standard metric for overlap-based accuracy. Across multiple test images, the method achieves Dice scores as high as 0.94, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing WBC structure. This pipeline offers a lightweight, interpretable alternative to deep learning-based approaches, making it well-suited for educational purposes, quick prototyping, and traditional medical imaging tasks where transparency and computational efficiency are priorities. The repository includes implementation code, visualization outputs, and terminal logs for validation, offering a clear and reproducible workflow from preprocessing to final accuracy evaluation.
