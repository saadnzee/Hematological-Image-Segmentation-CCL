# Hematological-Image-Segmentation-CCL
This project implements a classical image processing pipeline using Connected Component Analysis (CCA) to segment WBC cytoplasm and nucleus from blood smear images. Uses histogram-based V-set selection, post-processing, and Dice Coefficient for evaluation. Lightweight, interpretable, and reproducible.
